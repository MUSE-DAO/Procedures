VERSION 1.0

This will:
GENERATE A CUSTOM MAP IMAGE WITH A RED GEOMARKER IN YOUR LOCATION
CONNECT THE MAP TO HIVEMAP
GENERATE AND STORE A GEOMARKER AT HIVEMUSE.COM


Deploy inworld an image of 3x3 voxels or more.
This image will be your map, set it at the right postion.
Now face the map with your avatar and copy the coordinates of your location from the browser URL.
You should get something like N@373E,25S or N@373E,10U,25S

Note:
Coordinates starting with NE@ or SE@ or SW@ or NW@ ara not accepted
Only coordinates starting with N@, S@, W@, E@ are accepted.

Now PASTE your coordinates in the following script.
And choose the marker type you want between: commercial,art,culture,institutional,entertainment

////////////////////////////////////

let coords="PASTE_YOUR_COORDINATES_HERE";
let parcelType="CHOOSE_THE_MARKER_TYPE_HERE";
let version=1;
let description="";
let d = new Date();
let date=d.getDay();

feature.set({url:"http://hivemuse.com/map-image.php?coords="+coords+"&version="+version+"&date="+date+"&terminal=map"});
feature.set({link:"http://hivemuse.com/?coords="+coords+"&version="+version+"&date="+date+"&terminal=map"+"&type="+parcelType});

////////////////////////////////////

Now add the script to the image (map).
When you reload the page the script will add a URL and a HYPERLINK to your map.
CV will pull an image of the map for you with a marker "YOU ARE HERE".
Your map is now connected to MuseMap.
In case you experience problems in displaying the map:
Edit the map (E) and force saving data. (in the UI click on the image tab at the top and the floppy will appear).
Actually... after the second reload you should see the map with the marker in your location.

NOTE:
The marker will expire in one week.
Everytime someone clicks the map, he will postpone your geomarker expiration to one week later from the click.
Autoexpiring markers are meant to keep the map clean from terminals that may not exist anymore.

Wait for the next version of the script.
